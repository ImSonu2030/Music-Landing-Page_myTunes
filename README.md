<h1 align="center">My Tunes</h1>

## Overview

In this Project I used only **HTML** & **CSS**. This project has total two different pages. First is **Home** page which consist of products and services and at the top and bottom a Navigation menu. <br>And the second page is **MyTunes** which consist of some embedded link of Music from **Spotify** which are of course Playable, you can even Login to your Spotify account from here to play full music. <br>
- Leave this NOTE if you want<br>
**NOTE:** Rest Assure üëç Login from here is absolutly safe because while login a new page from Spotify server will Open, so all your credentials will be shared with only Spotify. Well why anyone Login from hereü§î<br>

And also I have added some cool hover effect try to hover over **Madilyn Bailey** or any other **Music frame** or **Nav link**/**buttons**.<br>
The **Home** page has a parralax background , It'll be fixed even though you move your mouse, thay makes Scrolling awesome üòé

## Objective
- Goal was to build a good looking Web Page using HTML & CSS.
- To make it responsive.
- To add cool hover effect. And I successfully did it
